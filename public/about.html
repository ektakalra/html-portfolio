<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Ekta Kalra and I work as a web developer.
   I am a software engineer who loves to create websites as well as apps for people. I think that people should look at the bigger picture when they are building something. I love to work in groups where everyone can voice their opinions and ideas.</p>
